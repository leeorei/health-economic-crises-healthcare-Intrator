# health-economic-crises-healthcare-Intrator
All files, including the paper, data, and code for Intrator study on effects of health and economic crises on US healthcare are contained in this repository.

To run the code in this repository download the repository and keep all documents in a single file, then run the Jupyter Notebook files in that folder. Do not keep data and code in separate files without changing the file locations when importing the data in the code to match your own machine.

Any questions regarding this repository or the study which this repository is linked to may be addressed to leeore.n.intrator@gmail.com.

Notes:
* Paper is still currently being finished (as of May 4, 2021) - will be available in this repository by May 6, 2021

* All code runs on Jupyter Notebooks for Python 3.8.3
  * "requirements.txt" file must be run using Python pip by running the following line "pip install -r requirements.txt" on the command line in the proper folder for the code in this repository to work properly on your local machine. For more information regarding this code please refer to the following link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/

* Model numbers for the regression results as described in "all regression results.html" will not match up perfectly to the model numbers in the paper because of issues regarding the quantity regressions discussed in the paper - which led to the paper excluding the quantity regressions for each segment as their measures would have excessive measurement error.
