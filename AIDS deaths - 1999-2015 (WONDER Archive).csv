Caveats:,,,,,
1. About national population figures: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal,,,,,
estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010 are bridged-race April 1 census counts;,,,,,

"resident population; population figures for 2011 are bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, from",,,,,

2. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the,,,,,
resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group.,,,,,
